		<h1>Zmanim Pro Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>Zmanim Pro doesn't collect any information. Like, at all. Nothing.</p>
		<p>The app is completely self-contained. It doesn't even require an internet connection.</p>
		<p>So, the privacy policy is: <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
		<p>Yes, it's private. That's the policy.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>We don't have your data.</li>
			<li>We don't want your data.</li>
			<li>We don't need your data.</li>
			<li>We don't even know what "your data" is.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>That's it. Thanks for using Zmanim Pro!</p>
